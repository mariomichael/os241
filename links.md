## WEEK 01
- [How to Enable VMX on Windows 11](https://youtu.be/3ZBwFcaed5w?si=vo-pdiIUtJa6Sia5) --- Tutorial on how to enable virtualization on Windows 11 in Bios. We still have to figure some things out because each processor or laptop has its interface. <br />
- [Vi Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm) --- Tutorial on how to use vi with a compact explanation. This is so far the most compact but clear website that explains Vi. <br />
- [Windows Powershell vs Command Prompt: What's The Difference Anyway?](https://youtu.be/H0gwnFV_SFs?si=kn803ZZCIeIVHRo1) --- A brief explanation of the differences between Windows Powershell and CMD. This makes it easier for me, who has just tried Powershell, to understand it better. <br />

## WEEK 02
- [Creating and Managing a GPG Key Pair](https://youtu.be/1vVIpIvboSg?si=1YwZmDy2T4MicRj6) --- Tutorial on how to creating and managing the GPG key pair. I think it's interesting because I had several problems when creating the GPG pair keys, and this video helped me a lot.
- [SSH by Dea Afrizal](https://youtu.be/HlSktNwxCW8?si=t2XiLyycGFxGCpHf) --- Contains an easy-to-understand explanation of SSH in everyday language. I think the video is interesting because the explanation is presented in a relaxed and informal manner, allowing listeners to learn in a more relaxed way.
- [Work With Tarballs on Linux](https://www.networkworld.com/article/966808/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html) It contains a concise explanation of Tarballs. This is interesting because the information is concise and very helpful for me.
